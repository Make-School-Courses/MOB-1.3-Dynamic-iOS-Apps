# Jigsaw - making a request ðŸ§©

- Class will be divided into two groups.
- Depending on how many members, choose one or two of the following links, making sure all the links are taken.

- [Link 1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/handle.md)
- [Link 2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/make.md)
- [Link 3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/present.md)
- [Link 4](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/setup.md)
- [Link 5](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.3-Dynamic-iOS-Apps/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson7/assignments/request/configure.md)


- As a group collaboratively write the code to perform a network request using
[codeshare](https://codeshare.io).

- Each member will write their step as they explain the importance of it and what it is doing.

- You will make a network call to fetch a To-do item using the tool [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

- When you are done, someone try the code in a playground to see if it works.

You should see something like this in the console:

```swift
{
    completed = 0;
    id = 1;
    title = "delectus aut autem";
    userId = 1;
}


```
- Share the codeshare link with the instructor (send it over slack).
