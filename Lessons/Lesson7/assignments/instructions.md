# Jigsaw - making a request ðŸ§©

- Class will be divided into two groups.
- Depending on how many members, choose one or two of the following links, making sure all the links are taken.

[Link 1]()
[Link 2]()
[Link 3]()
[Link 4]()
[Link 5]()


- As a group collaboratively write the code to perform a network request using
[codeshare](https://codeshare.io).

- Each member will write their step as they explain the importance of it and what it is doing.

- You will make a network call to fetch a To-do item using the tool [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

- When you are done, share the codeshare link with the instructor (send it over slack).
