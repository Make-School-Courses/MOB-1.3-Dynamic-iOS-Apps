# Dynamic iOS Apps

## Course Description

This course covers the programming concepts needed to create dynamic iOS applications that can respond to user events and connect with a back end service. Key concepts include closures, callbacks and delegates. Students will understand how these constructs work and how they are used to pass information and execute blocks of code. Common communication patterns and how memory management works will also be explored. Students will also learn how to fetch and parse information from the Internet through APIs. They will interact with public APIs with and without authentication, make network requests in iOS using native Swift tools, model a networking layer in iOS, and parse a JSON network response.

### Why you should know this

Most, if not all, mobile apps will need to communicate with an external service to work. It's important for you to know how to create this communication flow using native Swift tools. Communication within an app is also something you will need to implement as your apps get more complex. When you know different approaches to this problem, you'll be able to choose the one that best suits a specific need.

## Prerequisites:  

- [MOB 1.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.2-Introduction-to-iOS-Development-in-Swift)
- [BEW 1.2]()

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Use closures, callbacks and delegates to pass information and execute code
1. Identify and use different communication patterns in iOS
1. Explain how memory management works in Swift
1. Create a networking layer to make requests to public APIs with or without authentication
1. Parse a JSON network response using the Codable protocol
